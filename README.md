# fastv
fastv is an ultra-fast tool for identification of SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes from sequencing data. It detects microbial sequences from FASTQ data, generates JSON reports and visualizes the result in HTML reports. This tool can be used to detect viral infectious diseases, like COVID-19. This tool supports both short reads (Illumina, BGI, etc.) and long reads (ONT, PacBio, etc.)

# take a quick glance of the informative report
* Sample HTML report (Illumina): http://opengene.org/fastv/fastv.html
* Sample HTML report (ONT): http://opengene.org/fastv/ont.html
* Sample JSON report: http://opengene.org/fastv/fastv.json

# quick example
* download FASTQ file for testing: http://opengene.org/fastv/testdata.fq.gz
* get fastv and use following command for testing: 
```shell
./fastv -i testdata.fq.gz
```

# how it works?
`fastv` accepts FASTQ files as input, and then:
1. performs data QC and quality filtering as `fastp` does (cut adapters, remove low quality reads, correct wrong bases).
2. scans the clean data to collect the sequences that containing any unique k-mer, or can be mapped to any reference microbial genomes.
3. makes statistics, visualizes the result in HTML format, and output the results in JSON format.
4. outputs the on-target sequencing reads so that they can be analyzed by downstream tools.

# understand the input
`fastv` accepts following files as input:
1. `FASTQ` file (required) to be scanned, can be single-end (`-i`) or paired-end (`-i` and `-I`), can be short reads (Illumina, MGI, etc.) or long reads (PacBio, ONT, etc.)
2. `genomes` file (optional): a FASTA file containing one or many reference genomes of the target microorganism (`-g`).
3. `k-mer` file (optional): a FASTA file containing the UNIQUE k-mer of the target microbial genomes (`-k`).
4. `k-mer collection` file (optional): a FASTA containing the unique k-mers of many microorganisms (`-c`). See an example: http://opengene.org/kmer_collection.fasta

If none of (`k-mer`, `k-mer collection`, `genomes`) files is specified, fastv will try to load the SARS-CoV-2 Genomes/k-mer files in the `data` folder to detect SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

Besides the HTML/JSON reports, fastv also can output the sequence reads that contains any unique k-mer or can be mapped to any of the target reference genomes. The output data:
* is in FASTQ format
* is clean data after quality filtering
* the file names can be specified by `-o` for SE data, or `-o` and `-O` for PE data.

## get the pre-built k-mer file, genomes file or k-mer collection file for viruses
* You can download `k-mer` files and `genomes` files of viruses from http://opengene.org/uniquekmer/viral/index.html. This is generated by extracting unique k-mers for all genomes in a big FASTA (http://opengene.org/viral.genomic.fasta), which contains all NCBI complete RefSeq release of viral sequences that can be found from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/. The k-mers that can be mapped to human reference genome (GRCh38) with `edit_distance <= 3` have already been filtered out.
* You can download the `k-mer collection` file for viral genomes from: http://opengene.org/viral.kc.fasta.gz

## get the pre-built k-mer file, genomes file or k-mer collection file for viruses and human microorganisms
* You can download `k-mer` files and `genomes` files of viruses from http://opengene.org/uniquekmer/microbial/index.html. This is generated by extracting unique k-mers for all genomes in a big FASTA (http://opengene.org/microbial.genomic.fasta), which contains genomes for the viruses above and common human microorganisms. The k-mers that can be mapped to human reference genome (GRCh38) with `edit_distance <= 3` have already been filtered out.
* You can download the `k-mer collection` file for viral genomes from: http://opengene.org/microbial.kc.fasta.gz
* you can get the `k-mer` file and `genomes` file for SARS-CoV-2 by `git clone https://github.com/OpenGene/fastv.git`. If you don't use git, you can also download these two files from http://opengene.org/fastv/SARS-CoV-2.kmer.fa and http://opengene.org/fastv/SARS-CoV-2.genomes.fa


If you want to generate your own unique k-mer files and k-mer collection files, please use UniqueKMER: https://github.com/OpenGene/UniqueKMER

# understand the output
fastv outputs reports in HTML and JSON formats.
* Sample HTML report (Illumina): http://opengene.org/fastv/fastv.html
* Sample JSON report: http://opengene.org/fastv/fastv.json
* If the `k-mer` file is specified, there will be a `POSITIVE` or `NEGATIVE` result, which is determined by comparing the mean depth of the k-mer keys to the threshold (`--positive_threshold`).

Besides the HTML/JSON reports, fastv also can output the sequence reads that contains any unique k-mer or can be mapped to any of the target reference genomes. The output data:
 * is in FASTQ format
 * is clean data after quality filtering
 * the file names can be specified by `-o` for SE data, or `-o` and `-O` for PE data.
